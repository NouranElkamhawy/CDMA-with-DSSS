# CDMA with DSSS
 simulate the transmission of N mobile stations of different users. Simulating the Performance of DSSS system generating PN sequence using linear feedback shift registerThe transmission schema is QPSK-DSSS.  QPSK will be composed of 2 arrays in phase component and quad phase component.
